  In the TrybeTunes project, I developed an application similar to spotify, capable of playing songs from the most varied bands and artists, creating a list of favorite songs and editing the user's profile. This application will be able to:
   - Login;
   - Search for a band or artist;
   - List available albums by that band or artist;
   - View songs from a selected album;
   - Favorite and unfavorite songs;
   - View the list of favorite songs;
   - View the profile of the logged-in person;
   - Edit the profile of the logged-in person;
   - memo Skills
  
  In the future I intend to develop a backend for this application
