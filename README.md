  In the TrybeTunes project, I developed an application similar to spotify, capable of playing songs from the most varied bands and artists, creating a list of favorite songs and editing the user's profile. This application will be able to:
   - Login;
   - Search for a band or artist;
   - List available albums by that band or artist;
   - View songs from a selected album;
   - Favorite and unfavorite songs;
   - View the list of favorite songs;
   - View the profile of the logged-in person;
   - Edit the profile of the logged-in person;
   - memo Skills
  
  In the future I intend to develop a backend for this application

In this project I aplied concepts of: 

- Make requests and consume data coming from an `API`;

- Use the lifecycles of a React component;

- Use the `setState` function to ensure that a given code is only executed after the state is updated

- Use the `BrowserRouter` component correctly;

- Create routes, mapping the URL path with the corresponding component, via `Route`;

- Using `Switch` from `React Router`

- Create navigation links in the application with the `Link` component;
