  In the TrybeTunes project, I developed an application similar to spotify, capable of playing songs from the most varied bands and artists, creating a list of favorite songs and editing the user's profile. This application will be able to:
   - Login;
   - Search for a band or artist;
   - List available albums by that band or artist;
   - View songs from a selected album;
   - Favorite and unfavorite songs;
   - View the list of favorite songs;
   - View the profile of the logged-in person;
   - Edit the profile of the logged-in person;
   - memo Skills
  
  In the future I intend to develop a backend for this application

  <summary><strong>:memo: Skills</strong></summary><br />

In this project I aplied concepts of: 

- Make requests and consume data coming from an `API`;

- Use the lifecycles of a React component;

- Use the `setState` function to ensure that a given code is only executed after the state is updated

- Use the `BrowserRouter` component correctly;

- Create routes, mapping the URL path with the corresponding component, via `Route`;

- Using `Switch` from `React Router`

- Create navigation links in the application with the `Link` component;

To ensure the quality of the code, I used the `ESLint` and `StyleLint` linters in this project.
  This way the code will be in line with good development practices, being more readable
  and easy to maintain! To run them locally in the project, run the commands below:

  ```bash
    npm run lint
    npm run lint:styles
  ```

  In addition to code quality and meeting requirements, a good layout is one of the aspects responsible for improving the usability of an application.

  For that, I made available this [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/pkocuFSMsqmUqvMUbsfcRp/%5BProjeto%5D%5BFrontend%5D-Trybetunes?node-id=0%3A1).
